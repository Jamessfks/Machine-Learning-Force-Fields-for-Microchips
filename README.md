# Machine-Learning-Force-Fields-for-Microchips
ORNL #3. Using ML to Understand Materials Inside Microchips. The tool we will be using is MACE - Machine Learning Force Fields.
MACE is a a machine learning software for predicting many-body atomic interactions and generating force fields. It utilizes higher-order equivariant message passing for fast and accurate predictions.
